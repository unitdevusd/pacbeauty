# Teresa's Beauty Salon Hair Salon

Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a Hair Salon website, to advertise their services, Open hours, address and contact details.


### Demo

A live demo can be found [here](https://femy16.github.io/hair_salon/).

### UX

My goal was to design a website for a hair salon, using bootstrap.

Customers search for salons which match their required servises, price, open hours,location and they will get the contact details to book an appoinment using mobile, tablet or desktop, the website is designed as responsive to display in all this type of devices.

#### Structure and Design

All the design process was developed paying attention to the User Experience. Making sure that the users' experience is as positive as posible, easy to follow and well structured.

I have added four pages for the website the home, services, products and contact us.The nav bar contains links to all four pages. The home page contains images of the salon as carousel, about the Teresa's Beauty Salon Hair Salon, reviews from the customers.
The services page contains the services and price lists. The product page displayes all the products that are used in the hair salon, I have used card to display each product and each card as a link to the website of the products so that 
customers can familiarise with products. The Contact page contains a small form to sent concerns and reviews to the salon, a google map Iframe to show the location, Phone Number and email Id to contact and open hours of the salon.
the footer contains the contact details and Open hours.

### Technologies

+ HTML
+ CSS
+ Bootstrap (3.3.7)

### Features

+ The navbar stays collapsed in the mobile screen size for responsiveness design.
+ The Salon Icon and other contents in footer displays and hide according to screen size.
+ All the Icons (social-media,location Pin),links and product cards are having hover effects.

#### Features Left to Implement

+ When the form in contact page is submitted the message must be mailed to the Teresa's Beauty Salon mail Id. 
+ When clicked on the Phone number it should dial the number if website is opened in Mobile Phone.

### Testing

+ Responsive : The website has been tested in different viewports and it is responsive.
+ Links : All the links included in the website have been tested and they are all working.
+ Hover : Hover effects on icons, links and cards have been tested and they al change color or have a hover effect working as expected.
